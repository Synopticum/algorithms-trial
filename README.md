## About

This is a set of algorithms I implemented during self-education. Based on:

- [Grokking Algorithms (by Aditya Y. Bhargava)](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)
- [The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures (by Stephen Grider)](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure)
- [The algorithms and data structures (by Niklaus Wirth)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/5519512183/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tpbk_p1_i2)

## How to start

First, create `.env` file in repository root folder with the content below:
```
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
NODE_ENV=development

API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Run next commands:
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev:web` to start webpack development server on http://localhost:9000

Enjoy
